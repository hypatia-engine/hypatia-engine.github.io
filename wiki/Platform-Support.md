## Supported Platforms

Although Hypatia is a cross-platform project (Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD), it puts FreeBSD development first. Hypatia tries to support as many platforms as possible. It should work in just about any operating system where Python and Pygame are available. This more-so talks about what is _specifically_ supported and tested.

FreeBSD is the developer's primary operating system.

Operating system support (in order of priority):

  1. BSD
   1. FreeBSD
   2. OpenBSD
   3. NetBSD
  2. Linux
   1. Debian
   2. Ubuntu

  4. Mac
  5. Android (not actually supported YET)
