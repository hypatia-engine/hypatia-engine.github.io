Want to get started contributing to Hypatia? Here's a few ways to help out, and chat to the other developers of the project!

## Tackle a "help wanted" issue

The Hypatia GitHub repository has a collection of issues that are marked as "help wanted". These issues are a good place to start jumping in to development of the engine.

The current "help wanted" issues are listed [over here](https://github.com/hypatia-engine/hypatia/labels/help%20wanted).

## Chat with the developers on Slack

The Hypatia developers all talk on Slack, a team communication platform. If you would like to join us and contribute ideas, or just chat with the team, you can join by sending Lillian an email, at [lillian.lynn.lemmer@gmail.com](mailto:lillian.lynn.lemmer@gmail.com).
