Lillian Lemmer is the creator/author of Hypatia. It's her baby. She wrote this wiki. She did the programming, the architecture, artwork (except the tilesheet), and really _all aspects_ of Hypatia; developed from the bottom of her heart as a labor of love.

# A note from the creator

I have always been interested in creating worlds. I remember being a little girl and wanting to create a world that could interact with me. One of the first tools I used for game development was [OHRRPGCE](http://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page). OHRRPCE made me think about games from the perspective of a developer. Soon thereafter I was making games in JavaScript and HTML, then I started to pick up Python much later on. I think my mission drive in all of my open source code is to just get someone hooked on making things; to inspire people to create worlds.
