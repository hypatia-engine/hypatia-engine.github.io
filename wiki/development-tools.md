## Python Tools

### Cheat Sheets

- **PDF:** [Python 3 Cheat Sheet](https://perso.limsi.fr/pointal/_media/python:cours:mementopython3-english.pdf)

### Pyflakes

[Pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes) is a linter for Python which helps catch errors and warnings while programming, e.g. unused imports, instead of having to wait and run the application to see such problems appear.  It is also useful in conjunction with [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) to catch stylistic problems, i.e. those which do not conform to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
